### For Victims of Sexual Violence

UC Berkeley provides a wealth of resources to support victims of sexual violence. One can seek help through the [PATH to Care center](https://care.berkeley.edu/), which provides [these services](https://care.berkeley.edu/get-resources/).

It is always the victims' decision to pursue any resources or to report an incident. If one chooses to report an incident, there are several ways:
    
- If there is an immediate threat, dial 911.
- For non-emergencies, call UCPD at (510)642-6760 or Berkeley PD at (510)981-5900
- Visit a medical center. Tell a medical professional that you wish to report a crime.

To learn more about options in the area, call the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 800.656.HOPE (4673).

If one wishes to report someone in the physics department to the physics department, there's [an anonymous tip box](https://physics.berkeley.edu/equity-inclusion/climate-feedback).


### DeCal: Introduction to Problem Solving in Physics

- Physics 98 (1 unit)
- Class #: [24767](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2024-fall-physics-98-003-grp-003)
- Time: TBD
- Location: TBD

Physics 98: Introduction to Problem Solving in Physics is a 1 unit P/NP student-run class where you can learn problem solving methods and mathematical tools for first semester physics. It’s a great opportunity to build your physics intuition, strengthen your problem solving toolset, and find your community in physics. First semester physics can be the most challenging course in the whole degree, but it's also a great chance to build intuition for concepts that come back again and again, and we're here to support you along the way! It's 6-7pm in Social Sciences 155, and you can enroll through the enrollment center. We hope you'll join us for an exciting journey in mechanics!

### DeCal: Hidden Intersections: Addressing Systemic Bias in STEM

What is technology's role in reinforcing oppression? What power structures exist in Academia? How do we prevent AI models from demonstrating racial and gender biases? If these are questions that you’re interested in engaging with, consider taking the two-unit DeCal Hidden Intersections: Addressing Systemic Bias in STEM (CCN 24752), the only ethics-based course in the physics department! See course description below:

- Physics 98/198 (2 units)
- Class #: [24751](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2024-fall-physics-98-002-grp-002), [24752](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2024-fall-physics-198-002-grp-002)
- Time: Tu 11:00 am - 12:30 pm
- Location: Hearst Field Annex B1
- Facilitators: Cassidy Sullivan (she/her) & Mateo Cardona Serrano (they/them)

This is a discussion course focusing on the past and present of systemic bias in STEM, specifically in the physical sciences. The first half of the course will be concerned mainly with studying the narrative of science; how the story of science has been told, who is telling those stories, and how this privileges some people and leaves out others. In the second half of the course, we will ask what it means to be an ethical scientist and explore how society and science intersect. Throughout, there will be an emphasis on students actively engaging with the ideas of the course in their own lives; the mini-project and a final capstone are the main examples of this. There are no prerequisites for this Decal. All that is required is an enthusiasm to learn and discuss the course material!

### DeCal: Differential Geometry and Lie Groups for Physics Students

- Physics 198 (2-3 units)
- Class #: [22357](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2024-fall-physics-198-001-grp-001)
- Time: Tu/Thu 5:00 - 6:30 pm
- Location: Cory 247 
- Facilitators: Michelle Dong, Keshav Deoskar, & Finn Fraser Grathwol


This course aims to introduce the basic concepts in differential geometry and Lie groups that are essential for better understanding the ideas in theoretical physics. Some topics introduced in this course include smooth manifolds, vector and tensor fields, pullback and pushforward, induced metric tensor, Lie derivatives, exterior algebra, differential and integral of forms, Lie groups and Lie algebra and their representations, parallel transport, connections, bundles, gauge theories, spinors, and the Index theorem. 

 Through this course, we hope to build a bridge between the mathematical and physical concepts for those interested in studying theoretical physics or who are curious about differential geometry and Lie algebra and how they are connected to physics and used in research in mathematical physics, high energy theory, and condensed matter theory. We will also provide resources for those who want to learn more about these topics.
